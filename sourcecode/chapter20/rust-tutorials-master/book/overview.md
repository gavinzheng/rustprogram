# Rust Tutorials

These are some miscellaneous [Rust](http://rust-lang.org/) tutorials put together as I learn them. Hopefully they can help other people who might want to do the same things.

All of the sources for the projects are on GitHub: [zicklag/rust-tutorials](https://github.com/zicklag/rust-tutorials).

- [Rust Plugins](./rust-plugins.md) - Learn how to setup dynamically loadable plugins for your Rust app. **Deprecated**
